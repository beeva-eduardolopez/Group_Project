        <p>Our contests are based on real-time point spreads that are used to establish favorites and underdogs.</p>
        <p>Instead of picking players based on their statistics, our contests are based on outcomes of games vs. the point spread
            and the over/under. The concept behind our game is fun, easy, mobile and patent pending.</p>
